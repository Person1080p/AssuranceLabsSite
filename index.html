                <h1>Next-Generation Software Assurance</h1>
                <p>
                    The goal of AssuranceLabs Inc. is to develop and market breakthrough technology that automates next-generation 
                    software assurance and cyber security analysis for enterprise risk reduction at scale. This technology is based 
                    on years of university research and is unlike anything available today. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of this new assurance technology is mathematics-based completeness and
                    correctness of source code written in a variety of languages. No gaps, no heuristics, no
                    approximations. Nothing left out. Use-cases include software development and testing,
                    malware detection and analysis, supply chain and open-source validation, maintenance and
                    evolution, AI/ML/DNN validation, forensic analysis, and reverse engineering.

            <h1>Function Extraction Technology</h1>
            <p>
                Traditional software assurance depends largely on testing,
                which, no matter how extensive, can exercise only a fraction of possible paths in code, and
                those only partially. The result can be untested functionality laden with risk that can result in
                software failures and breaches despite best efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                AssuranceLabs is working with a leading university to develop its Function Extraction tm product
                that computes the full behavior of software for precise verification of functionality and
                detection of malicious content. This technology extracts the entire domain-to-range
                functionality of all possible behaviors in code, essentially producing its as-built specification.
                Most current testing and analysis tools cannot do this. Function Extraction tm provides an answer
                to the simple question, “What does your software do?” in all circumstances of use. The
                technology can be applied to any source language and any application domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                A critical breakthrough is extracting the precise functionality of loops, a problem that has
                resisted practical solution despite decades of research. Most analysis tools simply unroll loops
                once or twice as an approximation of behavior that is guaranteed to be suspect. Computation
                of loop functionality has been the missing ingredient that enables a new level of precision and
                rigor in software assurance.
            </p>
            <P>
                This technology is based on the mathematical foundations of invariant relations, embodied in
                new theorems and algorithms that can automatically compute the full behavior of software.

            <h1>The Enterprise Value of Reduced Risk</h1>
            <p>
                Enterprise value lies in risk reduction through
                precise, automated software assurance achieved with reduced cost and effort. Validation of
                intended functionality and security properties can detect and eliminate sources of risk before
                they become known through unanticipated events. Knowing the full behavior of software
                means increased security and resiliency for federal and commercial systems of all kinds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computed behavior is a Digital Twin of the code, a precise definition of its behavior to support
                maintenance, evolution, and operational security. Code paired with its computed behavior is
                more valuable to an enterprise than code alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                AssuranceLabs is seeking partners to collaborate in evolution and deployment of its next-
                generation Function Extraction tm software assurance platform.

            <h1>Program Correctness in Software Engineering Education</h1>
            <p>
                Review of typical computer science
                curricula reveals that programmer education proceeds in three broad steps: years one and two,
                introduction to programming concepts; years two and three, algorithms, data structures, and
                discrete mathematics; years three and four, programming language concepts and semantics,
                and an introduction to program verification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, students are generally taught how to write programs before being taught how to write
                correct programs, or even what a correct program is. Software engineering is the only
                engineering discipline burdened by this educational paradox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Function Extraction™ can help students specify and verify programs as they are written. It is
                easy to imagine a student starting a session with a vaguely formulated specification and an
                incorrect program, and concluding the session with a valid specification and a correct program.
                Instilling program verification principles will serve students well over their entire professional
                careers. For more information, contact Rick Linger at <a href="mailto:rick.linger@assurancelabs.tech">rick.linger@assurancelabs.tech</a>
