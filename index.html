            <h1>Function Extraction Technology</h1>
            <p>
                Traditional software assurance depends largely on testing,
                which, no matter how extensive, can exercise only a fraction of possible paths in code, and
                those only partially. The result can be untested functionality and potential risk that can result in
                software failures and breaches despite best efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                AssuranceLabs is working with a leading university to develop its Function Extraction&trade; product
                that computes the full behavior of software for precise verification of functionality and
                detection of malicious content. This technology extracts the entire domain-to-range
                functionality of behaviors in code, essentially producing its as-built specification. Most current
                testing and analysis tools cannot do this. Function Extraction&trade; provides an answer to the simple
                question, &ldquo;What does your software do?&rdquo; in all circumstances of use. The technology can be
                applied to any source language and any application domain. A single Function Extraction&trade; run
                can provide more information about product quality than a large number of test runs.
            </p>
            <p>
                A critical breakthrough is extracting the precise functionality of loops, a problem that has
                resisted practical solution despite decades of research. Most analysis tools simply unroll loops
                once or twice as an approximation of behavior that is guaranteed to be suspect. Computation
                of loop functionality has been the missing ingredient that enables a new level of precision and
                rigor in software assurance.
            </p>
            <P>
                This technology is based on the mathematical foundations of invariant relations, embodied in
                new theorems and algorithms that can automatically compute the full behavior of software.

            <h1>The Enterprise Value of Reduced Risk</h1>
            <p>
                The enterprise value of Function Extraction&trade; lies in
                reduced risk through precise, automated software assurance achieved with less cost and effort.
                Validation of intended functionality and security properties can detect and eliminate sources of
                risk before they become known through unanticipated events. Knowing the full behavior of
                software means increased security and resiliency for government and commercial systems of all
                kinds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computed behavior is a Digital Twin of the code. It is a precise definition of behavior that
                supports informed maintenance and evolution, and reduces technical debt. Code paired with its
                computed behavior is more valuable than code alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                AssuranceLabs is seeking partners to collaborate in evolution and deployment of its next-
                generation Function Extraction&trade; software assurance platform.

            <h1>Program Correctness in Software Engineering Education</h1>
            <p>
                Typical computer science curricula
                defines programmer education in three broad steps: years one and two, introduction to
                programming concepts; years two and three, algorithms, data structures, and discrete
                mathematics; years three and four, programming language concepts and semantics, and
                (possibly) an introduction to program verification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, students are generally taught how to write programs before being taught how to write
                correct programs, or even what a correct program is. Software engineering is the only
                engineering discipline burdened by this educational paradox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Function Extraction&trade; can help students specify and verify programs as they are written. It is
                easy to imagine a student starting a session with a vaguely formulated specification and an
                incorrect program, and concluding the session with a valid specification and a correct program.
                Instilling program verification principles will serve students well over their entire professional
                careers. For more information, contact Rick Linger at <a href="mailto:rick.linger@assurancelabs.tech">rick.linger@assurancelabs.tech</a>
